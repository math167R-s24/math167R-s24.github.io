Weather Forecast Data\n\n1.  For this lab, we'll be using data on weather forecasts gathered by student at Saint Louis University. You can read about the dataset [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-12-20). Download the weather forecasts data using the following code:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    weather_forecasts <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-12-20/weather_forecasts.csv')\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n    ```\n    Rows: 651968 Columns: 10\n    ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n    Delimiter: \",\"\n    chr  (5): city, state, high_or_low, forecast_outlook, possible_error\n    dbl  (4): forecast_hours_before, observed_temp, forecast_temp, observed_precip\n    date (1): date\n    \n    ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\n    ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n2.

Create a new data frame containing only the forecasts for San Jose.
