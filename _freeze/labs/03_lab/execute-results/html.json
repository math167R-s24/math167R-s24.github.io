For this lab, we'll be using data on weather forecasts gathered by student at Saint Louis University. You can read about the dataset [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-12-20). Download the weather forecasts data using the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nweather_forecasts <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-12-20/weather_forecasts.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  How many rows are in this dataset? How many columns?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n3.  How many cities are represented in this dataset?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n4.  Create a new data frame containing only the forecasts for San Jose. You may have to explore the values for the `city` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n5. Compute the mean absolute error between `observed_temp` and `forecast_temp` for San Jose.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n6. Compute the mean absolute error between `observed_temp` and `forecast_temp` for San Jose using only forecasts made 48 hours in advance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n7. Compute the mean absolute error between `observed_temp` and `forecast_temp` for San Jose using only forecasts made 12 hours in advance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n8. Compare your answers to 6 and 7. What do you notice? How does this compare to your expectation?\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n9. Pick two cities in this dataset. Investigate whether the forecast accuracy is better for one city than for the other, using an appropriate statistic. Discuss your findings.\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n## B. Find your own data\n\nFor this component, pick a [Tidy Tuesday dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023) and complete the following activity.\n\n10. Provide a brief description of your dataset. Identify at least two questions you could try to answer using this dataset.\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n11. Open your dataset in R and compute one or more descriptive statistics that shed light on your questions. Discuss your findings.\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n12. Are there any limitations of your analysis? Could additional data or more complicated methods improve your analysis? Discuss.\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n",
