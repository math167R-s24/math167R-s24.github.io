Bootstrapping the sampling distribution of the median\n\n1. Using the `penguins` dataset in the `palmerpenguins` package, construct a confidence interval for the mean `body_mass_g` for female Adelie penguins based on using a normal distribution based on the central limit theorem. You should compute the confidence interval without using `confint()`.\n\n2. Construct a bootstrap confidence interval for the mean `body_mass_g` for female Adelie penguins using 10000 resamples.\n\n3. Construct a bootstrap confidence interval for the median `body_mass_g` for female Adelie penguins using 10000 resamples.\n\n## B. Simulations\n\n4. Suppose that $Y\\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(X)$ where $X\\sim \\mathrm{Exponential}(1)$. Use simulation to estimate $E(Y)$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(Y)$.\n\n5. For this question, you will write a simulation to test the frequentist coverage of a 95\\% confidence interval for a proportion based on the normal approximation. \n\n    a. First, write a function that takes two inputs: `n` and `p`. Your function should randomly generate some $X\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)$, compute $\\widehat{p}= X/n$, and then compute the corresponding normal distribution-based confidence interval for $p$ **based on your sample** $\\widehat{p}$. Your function should return `TRUE` if $p$ is in the confidence interval. You may use the following formula for the confidence interval:\n    \n    $$\\widehat{p}\\pm z_{.975}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p}(1-\\widehat{p})}{n}}$$\n        \n    b. Next, write a second function that takes three inputs: `n`, `p`, and `n_runs`, representing the number of times to run your simulation. This function should use your function from (a) to simulate `n_runs` binomial random variables and return the proportion of the `n_runs` for which $p$ is contained in the confidence interval.\n    \n    c. Test your function from (b) with `n = 20`, `p = .5`, and `n_runs = 1000`.\n    \n    d. Use your simulation code to investigate the following questions: For what values of `n` and `p` is the frequentist coverage close to the expected 95\\% value? For what values of `n` and `p` is the frequentist coverage very different to the expected 95\\% value?\n\n\n",
