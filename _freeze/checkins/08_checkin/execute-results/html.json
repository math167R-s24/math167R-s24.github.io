Write a function `sum_for_loop()`, that takes as input two vectors of length $n$, `x` and `y`, and returns the vector sum of `x` and `y` using a for loop of $n$ steps where the $i$th step involves adding `x[i]` and `y[i]`, Write a function `sum_vectorized()` that takes as input two vectors of length $n$, `x` and `y`, and computes the vector sum using the vectorized operator `x+y`.\n\n2. Compare the speed of your two functions using one of the approaches discussed in class today.\n",
