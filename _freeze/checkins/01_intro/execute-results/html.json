On the computer you are using, create a new folder titled \"MATH167R\" or something similar.\n\n2. Within this folder, create a sub-folder named \"checkins\" or something similar.\n\n3. Download \"01_first-R-code.R\" and save it in your checkins folder.\n\n4. Open \"01_first-R-code.R\" in RStudio. It should look something like the code below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n5. \n\n5.
