(Project Euler Problem 1) The natural numbers less than 10 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these numbers is 23. Write R code to compute the sum of all the numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 3 or 5.\n\n\n## A. \n\n1. Download the median age by state tables for 2010 and 2020 from the Canvas assignment [here](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1571636/assignments/6775084). You can use the `read_csv` function from the `readr` package to open these files and save them as `age_2010` and `age_2020`.\n \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n2. Create a scatter plot with each state as a point, with 2020 median age on the y-axis and 2010 median age on the x-axis. You may use any of the functions we have discussed in class. Note that there are many possible solutions. My solution used `pivot_wider()`, `left_join()`, and `ggplot()`, but you are welcome to use any solution you wish.\n\n\n**Note**: the following commands were used to download this data using the `tidycensus` package. You do not need to run the following code: it is only provided in case you are curious about downloading data from the U.S. Census using R. In your final report, be sure that the following code chunk is set to `eval = F` and `echo = F`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidycensus)\n\n# the following code loads my local Census API Key, which is used to access \n# census data\nSys.getenv(\"CENSUS_API_KEY\")\n\n# 2010 median age by state\nage_2010 <- get_decennial(geography = \"state\", \n                          variables = \"P013I001\", \n                          year = 2010,\n                          sumfile = \"sf1\")\n\n# 2020 median age by state\nage_2020 <- get_decennial(geography = \"state\",\n                          variables = \"P13_001N\",\n                          year = 2020,\n                          sumfile = \"dhc\")\n\n\n# write to csv files\nwrite.csv(age_2010, \"~/Documents/MATH167R/data/median_age_by_state_2010.csv\")\nwrite.csv(age_2020, \"~/Documents/MATH167R/data/median_age_by_state_2020.csv\")\n```\n:::\n",
