Flights Data\n\n**1.**  For this lab, we'll be using the `flights` data. You can load this data using the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(nycflights13)\ndata(flights)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**2.** Use the `mutate()` function to turn `origin` into a factor.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n**3.** Compute the mean `arr_delay` for each origin airport. Which airport has the longest delays on average? You can drop missing rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n\n**4.** Use the `mutate()` function to turn `month` into a factor.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--# YOUR ANSWER/EXPLANATION HERE -->\n\n\n**5.** Compute the mean `arr_delay` by month.
