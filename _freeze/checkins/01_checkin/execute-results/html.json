This is a code chunk that opens the `mtcars` dataset, which contains information about on 32 cars from a 1974 issue of the magazine *Motor Trend* and creates a scatter plot with horsepower `hp` on the x-axis and miles-per-gallon `mpg` on the y-axis. Try running this code and Rendering/Knitting your Rmd document. If you have done this correctly, RStudio should produce an html document.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(mtcars)\nplot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_checkin_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2.  Using this scatter plot, describe the relationship between `mpg` and `hp`.\n\n3.  Create your own code chunk below this question containing the line of code `print(\"Hello MATH167R!\")`. Then Render/Knit your Rmd document. If you have done this correctly, RStudio should produce an html document.\n",
