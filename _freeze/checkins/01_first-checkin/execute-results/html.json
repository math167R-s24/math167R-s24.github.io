On the computer you are using, create a new folder titled \"MATH167R\" or something similar.\n\n2. Within this folder, create a sub-folder named \"checkins\" or something similar.\n\n3. Download \"[01_first-R-code.R](../static/01_first-R-code.R)\" and save it in your checkins folder.\n\n4. Open \"01_first-R-code.R\" in RStudio. It should look something like the code below.\n\n\n::: {.cell file='../static/01_first-R-code.R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsides <- c(\"H\", \"T\")\n\nflip1 <- sample(sides, 1, replace = T)\nprint(flip1)\n\nflip10 <- sample(sides, 10, replace = T)\nprint(flip10)\n```\n:::\n\n\n5. Run the code line by line and answer the two questions on the [Check-in 1 assignment](https://sjsu.instructure.com/courses/1571636/quizzes/1690553) on Canvas.\n\n\n6. For complete credit for Check-in 1, please also complete the pre-course survey and NameCoach recording (links on Canvas).\n\n7.
