Remember, **follow the instructions below and use R Markdown to create a pdf document with your code and answers to the following questions on Gradescope.** You may find a template file by clicking "Code" in the top right corner of this page.

1. The following code downloads two sequences of 460 digits. One of them was generated by asking ChatGPT to generate to "sample 1000 random digits from 0 to 9 with replacement" (I only got 460). The other was generated using the R command `sample(0:9, 460, replace = T)`. Which is from R and which is from ChatGPT? Explain and justify your answer.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
A <- readr::read_csv("https://math167r-s24.github.io/static/digits-a.csv")
B <- readr::read_csv("https://math167r-s24.github.io/static/digits-b.csv")
