1. The following code downloads two sequences of 256 digits. One of them was generated by asking ChatGPT to generate to "sample 1000 random digits from 0 to 9 with replacement" (I only got 256). The other was generated using the R command `sample(0:9, 256, replace = T)`. Which is from R and which is from ChatGPT? Explain and justify your answer.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
