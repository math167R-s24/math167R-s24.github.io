1. (Devore Section 7.2 #5) Assume that the helium porosity (in percentage) of coal samples taken from any particular seam is normally distributed with true standard deviation .75. Compute a 90% CI for the true average porosity of a certain seam if the average porosity for 20 specimens from the seam was 4.85.

2. The `trees` data set provides measurements for a sample of 31 felled black cherry trees. Based on this sample, create a 95% confidence interval for the population mean girth. You may use the command `data(trees)` to download this data.
