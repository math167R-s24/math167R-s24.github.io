## Random variables in R

We have already seen a number of functions for generating random variables such as `sample()` and `rnorm()`.

Today, we will expand on these functions and related functions for studying random variables and begin using them to write various simulations.

## Random variables in R

Remember that we can use the `sample()` function as follows to draw at random from a finite set with and without replacement:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
sample(0:9, 10, replace = T)
```

What if we want to generate $n$ samples from a normal distribution? Or a binomial distribution?

## Simulating a coin-flipping game

Can we write code to simulate this game?

## Simulating a coin-flipping game

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
n <- 100
flips <- sample(x = c("H", "T"), size = n, replace = T)
HH_score <- 0
HT_score <- 0
for (i in 2:n) {
  if (flips[i-1] == "H" & flips[i] == "H") {
    HH_score <- HH_score + 1
  } 
  if (flips[i-1] == "H" & flips[i] == "T") {
    HT_score <- HT_score + 1
  }
}
HH_score
HT_score
```

## Simulating a coin-flipping game

What if we want to simulate this game many times? One approach is to wrap our code in a function, which we can run many times.

## Simulating a coin-flipping game {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
run_one_sim <- function(seed, n) {
  set.seed(seed)
  flips <- sample(x = c("H", "T"), size = 100, replace = T)
  HH_score <- 0
  HT_score <- 0
  for (i in 2:n) {
    if (flips[i-1] == "H" & flips[i] == "H") {
      HH_score <- HH_score + 1
    } 
    if (flips[i-1] == "H" & flips[i] == "T") {
      HT_score <- HT_score + 1
    }
  }
  return(list(HH = HH_score, HT = HT_score))
}
# run 100000 simulations with n = 100
results <- lapply(1:10000, run_one_sim, n = 100)

HH_scores <- sapply(results, function(x) x$HH)
HT_scores <- sapply(results, function(x) x$HT)
```

## Simulating a coin-flipping game

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE

# proportion of Alice wins
mean(HH_scores > HT_scores)

# proportion of Bob wins
mean(HT_scores > HH_scores)

# proportion of ties
mean(HH_scores == HT_scores)
```

## Simulating a coin-flipping game

Why does Bob win more often? Intuitively, both "HH" and "HT" are equally likely when we flip a fair coin twice.

## Simulating a coin-flipping game

Here's a histogram of Alice and Bob's scores across the simulations. What do you notice? How might this explain our results?


```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| eval: TRUE
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = HH_scores, fill = "HH"), 
                 alpha = .5, binwidth = 1) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = HT_scores, fill = "HT"), 
                 alpha = .5, binwidth = 1) + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of scores for Alice and Bob") +
  xlab("Score")
```

## Simulating a coin-flipping game

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = HH_scores, fill = "HH"), 
                 alpha = .5, binwidth = 1) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = HT_scores, fill = "HT"), 
                 alpha = .5, binwidth = 1) + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of scores for Alice and Bob") +
  xlab("Score")
```

## The `r`, `p`, `d`, and `q` functions

What if we want to generate $n$ samples from a normal distribution? Or a binomial distribution?


R provides functions for working with a variety of probability distributions. For most distributions, there are four functions: `r`, `p`, `d`, and `q`. As an example, let's look at the normal distribution.

`rnorm()` can be used to generate `n` random observations from a normal distribution:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

## The `r`, `p`, `d`, and `q` functions

`pnorm()` can be used to compute the distribution function at a value `q`. In other words, if $Z$ is a standard normal, pnorm returns the value of $$F(q)= P\left(Z < \frac{q-\mu}{\sigma}\right)$$

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
pnorm(q = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
pnorm(q = 1, mean = 1, sd = 1)
```

## The `r`, `p`, `d`, and `q` functions

`qnorm()` can be used to compute the quantile function at a percentile `p`. In other words, if $Z$ is a standard normal the quantile function returns the value $x$ such that $$P\left(Z\leq \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)=p$$

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
qnorm(p = .75, mean = 0, sd = 1)
qnorm(p = .5, mean = 1, sd = 1)
```

## The `r`, `p`, `d`, and `q` functions

`dnorm()` can be used to compute the density function at a value `x`: $$ f(x)={\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}\exp\left\{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}\right\}$$

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
dnorm(x = .5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

## Exercise

Create a histogram of 1000 samples from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 20.

## Exercise

Suppose we perform a two-sided hypothesis test using a normal distribution and obtain a z-score of 1.24. How would we compute the p-value?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
2 * (1 - pnorm(q = 1.24, mean = 0, sd = 1))
```

. . .

Suppose we perform a two-sided hypothesis test using a normal distribution and obtain a z-score of -2.12. How would we compute the p-value?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
2 * pnorm(q = 2.12, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

## The `r`, `p`, `d`, and `q` functions: binomial distribution

Practice with the `rbinom()`, `pbinom()`, `dbinom()` and `qbinom()` functions:

1.  If I flip a coin with probability of heads = 0.6 ten times, what is the probability of observing **exactly** 6 heads?

2.  If I flip a coin with probability of heads = 0.6 ten times, what is the probability of observing 6 or fewer heads?

3.  Consider an experiment where you flip a coin with a probability of heads = .6 ten times. Simulate this experiment 1000 times and create a histogram of your results.

## Random seeds

Remember that `set.seed()` can be used to ensure that you obtain the same results each time you run your code.

For example, if you include the command `x <- rnorm(1)` in an .Rmd document with running `set.seed()`, each time you knit, you will produce a different value of `x`.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
set.seed(1022)
rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

## Monte Carlo methods

Monte Carlo methods or Monte Carlo experiments use repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results or to approximate quantities of interest.

Monte Carlo experiments are often used to:

-   approximate integrals
-   generate draws from a probability distribution
-   optimize functions stochastically

## Example: Transformations of random variables

Suppose $X\sim N(0, 1)$. What is $E(e^X)$?

We could use the change of variable formula to compute the expectation. Or we could use simulation to approximate this quantity. Asymptotic analysis is needed to study the convergence of our approximation.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
#| error: TRUE
n_sim <- 1000
n <- 100
exp_X <- numeric(n_sim)
for (i in 1:n_sim) {
  exp_X[i] <- exp(rnorm(n))
}
mean(exp_X)
```

## Example: Maximum of random variables

Suppose $X_i\sim \mathrm{Exponential}(1)$ for $1\leq i\leq n$, for some $n$.

-   What is $E(\mathrm{max}(X_1,\ldots, X_n))?$
-   How does $E(\mathrm{max}(X_1,\ldots, X_n))$ change for different values of $n$?

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
set.seed(1022)
n_sim <- 1000
n <- 10
maxes <- numeric(n_sim)
for (i in 1:n_sim) {
  maxes[i] <- max(rexp(n, rate = 1))
}
mean(maxes)
```

. . .

What about for $n=100$? Should the expected maximum be larger or smaller?

## Example: Maximum of random variables

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
n_sim <- 1000
n <- 100
maxes <- numeric(n_sim)
for (i in 1:n_sim) {
  maxes[i] <- max(rexp(n, rate = 1))
}
mean(maxes)
```

## `replicate()` for repeated evaluation

In the previous code, we have been using `for` loops, which explicitly and repeatedly change global variables.

We can alternatively use the `replicate()` function to repeatedly evaluate an expression and in particular to repeatedly generate data. The data will be automatically organized into a matrix or vector.

## `replicate()` for repeated evaluation

For example, we can repeatedly generate `n` exponential random variables:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
replicate(10, rexp(10)) # matrix output
```

## `replicate()` for repeated evaluation

Alternatively, we can repeatedly generate `n` exponential random variables and then take their maximum:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
replicate(10, max(rexp(10))) # vector output
```

## `replicate()` for repeated evaluation

Using `replicate()`, the previous simulation is just:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
maxes <- replicate(1000, max(rexp(n)))
mean(maxes)
```

## Example: Maximum of random variables

We can repeat this for many different values of `n`.

```{r declarative.sim}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
#| cache: TRUE
n_sim <- 1000
n_values <- c(10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000)
max_by_n <- c()
for (n in n_values) {
  maxes <- numeric(n_sim)
  for (i in 1:n_sim) {
    maxes[i] <- max(rexp(n, rate = 1))
  }
  max_by_n <- c(max_by_n, mean(maxes))
}
max_by_n
```

## Example: Maximum of random variables

Note that we can write the maximum of exponentials simulation using `replicate()`:

```{r functional.sim}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
#| cache: TRUE
max_by_n <- vapply(
  n_values, 
  function(n) mean(replicate(n_sim, max(rexp(n, rate = 1)))), 
  numeric(1)
)
max_by_n
```

## Example: Maximum of random variables

It turns out that $\mathrm{max}(X_1,\ldots, X_n)$ can be modeled using a Gumbel distribution (after being transformed). Below, we plot the empirical mean and approximate the theoretical expectation (for large $n$).

```{r plot_results}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE
#| cache: TRUE
plot(n_values, max_by_n,
     type = "l",
     xlab = "n", ylab = "Maximum",
     main = paste0("Sample mean of maximums (black)",
                   "and theoretical expectation (red)"))
lines(n_values, -digamma(1) + log(n_values), col = "red")
```

## Example: Maximum of random variables

```{r plot_results2}
#| echo: FALSE
#| eval: TRUE
#| cache: TRUE
plot(n_values, max_by_n,
     type = "l",
     xlab = "n", ylab = "Maximum",
     main = paste0("Sample mean of maximums (black)",
                   "and theoretical expectation (red)"))
lines(n_values, -digamma(1) + log(n_values), col = "red")
```
